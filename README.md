# Hotel Bar Inventory Forecasting

## Objective
Design a demand forecasting and inventory recommendation system that helps hotel bar managers:
- avoid stockouts (lost sales & poor guest experience)
- avoid overstocking (waste & capital lockup)

We forecast daily demand per bar and brand, compute optimal inventory levels (par levels), and simulate operational performance.

This notebook includes:
1. Data exploration
2. Feature engineering
3. Demand forecasting
4. Inventory logic (par level)
5. Simulation
6. Business evaluation
